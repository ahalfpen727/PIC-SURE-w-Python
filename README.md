 Hi Andrew,

This is our code test. Please make sure to read it carefully before attempting anything. 

Normally we give 7 calendar days to complete the test, but seeing as there is a holiday this coming week we will give you until the following Monday, November 30th. It should not take more than a few hours, but that will depend on how sharp your Python skills are.


To access the code test environment, please log into this URL using your Google credentials.
